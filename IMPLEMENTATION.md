# **Implementation Plan for AI-Powered Training Workflow Tool**

## **Phase 1: Core MVP - Setting Up the CrewAI Workflow**
**Goal:** Establish a basic CrewAI-driven workflow to test agent interaction and content generation.

### **Task 1: Install and Configure CrewAI**
- Install CrewAI and integrate it with Django
- Set up project structure following CrewAI best practices
- Implement models to support:
  - Standalone crews with agents and tasks
  - Flows that coordinate multiple crews
  - Hierarchical crew structures (sub-crews)
  - Task dependencies and context sharing

**Prompt for CursorAI:**
*"Set up CrewAI in Django with models supporting both standalone crews and coordinated flows."*

---

### **Task 2: Create Django Models and Admin Interface**
- Define flexible models for `CrewInstance`, `Agent`, and `Task`
- Support both single-crew and multi-crew workflows
- Implement relationships that allow:
  - Crews to contain agents and tasks
  - Flows to coordinate multiple crews
  - Tasks to depend on other tasks
- Add comprehensive Django Admin support for all models
- Include proper validation and error handling

**Prompt for CursorAI:**
*"Create Django models and admin interface supporting flexible crew configurations."*

---

### **Task 3: Implement Basic Crew Execution Flow**
- Create API app for all endpoints
- Develop endpoints for:
  - Creating and configuring crews/flows
  - Managing agents and their tools
  - Executing and monitoring tasks
- Implement task execution with proper state management
- Store execution results in the database
- Handle both standalone crews and coordinated flows

**Prompt for CursorAI:**
*"Create API endpoints for crew management and task execution."*

---

### **Task 4: Develop a Minimal Frontend**
- Create HTMX-based UI for:
  - Creating and managing crews/flows
  - Configuring agents and their tools
  - Defining and executing tasks
  - Monitoring task progress
- Add real-time updates using HTMX
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback

**Prompt for CursorAI:**
*"Build a minimal HTMX frontend for crew management and task execution."*

---

### **Task 5: Testing Suite**
- Implement comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Model validation and relationships
  - API endpoints and authentication
  - Task execution and state management
  - Flow coordination and crew interaction
- Test organization:
  - Unit tests for models and utilities
  - Integration tests for APIs
  - End-to-end tests for complete workflows
  - Performance tests for task execution
- Test scenarios:
  - Single crew operations
  - Multi-crew flows
  - Task dependencies and context sharing
  - Error handling and recovery
- Test location: `src/crew/tests/`

**Prompt for CursorAI:**
*"Create comprehensive test suite for CrewAI integration."*

---

## **Phase 2: Expanding Workflow with AI-Generated Content**
**Goal:** Extend CrewAI to generate slide content and talk tracks.

### **Task 6: Add AI-Generated Outline Enhancement**
- Implement an AI agent that takes a user's basic outline and expands it.
- Store AI-generated outlines in the database.

**Prompt for CursorAI:**
*"Create an AI agent that enhances a user-provided outline and saves it in Django models."*

---

### **Task 7: Generate AI-Based Slide Content**
- Develop an agent to generate slide text from an outline.
- Store slide data in a structured format.

**Prompt for CursorAI:**
*"Create an AI agent that generates slide content from an outline and stores it in Django."*

---

### **Task 8: Implement AI-Generated Talk Tracks**
- Extend the workflow to generate a talk track for each slide.
- Store the generated text alongside slide content.

**Prompt for CursorAI:**
*"Implement an AI agent that generates talk tracks for slides and saves them in Django models."*

---

## **Phase 3: User-in-the-Loop Enhancements**
**Goal:** Allow users to edit, approve, and refine AI-generated content.

### **Task 9: Implement a Review & Editing System**
- Create a UI to display AI-generated content with user edit functionality.
- Store version history for rollback.

**Prompt for CursorAI:**
*"Develop a UI and database structure to allow users to review, edit, and save AI-generated content."*

---

### **Task 10: Introduce Multi-User Collaboration**
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for user permissions.
- Allow multiple users to collaborate on training content.

**Prompt for CursorAI:**
*"Implement multi-user collaboration with role-based access control in Django."*

---

## **Phase 4: Advanced Features & Exporting**
**Goal:** Enhance the platform with media recommendations and export capabilities.

### **Task 11: AI-Powered Media Recommendations**
- Add an AI agent to suggest animations, visuals, and videos for slides.
- Store recommendations for user review.

**Prompt for CursorAI:**
*"Create an AI agent that recommends media elements (animations, images, videos) for training slides."*

---

### **Task 12: Implement Export Options (PDF, PPT, HTML)**
- Develop an export system to convert slides and talk tracks into different formats.

**Prompt for CursorAI:**
*"Implement an export system to generate PDF, PowerPoint, and HTML versions of training content."*

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- **Speech-to-Text Feedback**: Allow users to adjust scripts verbally.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users editing in parallel.
- **Interactive Training Mode**: Convert content into interactive learning experiences.

---

This **phased approach** ensures a structured MVP focusing on **CrewAI workflow execution** before expanding into **user collaboration, content generation, and exporting capabilities**. ðŸš€
